# Simulation study plan for dual treatment analysis 

## Overall design

We simulate patient trajectories in continuous time from the first
prescription of GLP1 until MACE, death or censoring.

## Aims

### For starters
We aim to demonstrate that our ltmle analyses are nearly unbiased in
the dual treatment situation.

### Background drug design

Evaluated different analysis designs for polypharmacy studies:

- dual treatment with ltmle
- sequential nested trial design
- prevalent new user design
